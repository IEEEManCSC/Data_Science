# Data Science Roadmap

## Here we have two files:
* Roadmap:  Contains the full roadmap as headlines and each one has some suggested courses. <br>
* Roadmap_into_weeks (recommended):  The same roadmap, but a specific course was chosen in each subject and it was divided into weeks, at a studying rate of 7 hours per week.
